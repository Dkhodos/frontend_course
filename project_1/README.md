## Project Structure

### File and Folder Descriptions

- **index.html**: The main landing page of the application. This page serves as the entry point for users and provides links to other sections of the application, such as user and admin interfaces.

- **global.css**: A global stylesheet for resetting default browser styles and applying base styles like `box-sizing`, margins, padding, font settings, and body background color. This ensures a consistent foundation for styling across all pages.

- **README.md**: The projectâ€™s README file, containing an overview of the project, instructions, and descriptions of the file structure and functionality. It serves as a guide for understanding and navigating the project.

- **public/**: A folder for storing static assets such as images, icons, or other media files used throughout the application. For instance, `plain.webp` might be an image used on multiple pages.

- **pages/**: This directory contains all the HTML files for individual pages within the application. Each page or feature (such as booking flights, managing flights, or viewing user bookings) has its own folder within `pages/`, which includes the specific `index.html` and `styles.css` files required for that section. For example:
  - `pages/book_flight/` contains the HTML and CSS files for booking a flight, organized further by specific flight IDs (e.g., `W61283`, `LX8396`).
  - `pages/add_flight/` contains files for the add flight functionality.
  - `pages/user_manage_bookings/` holds files for viewing and managing user bookings.


### Requirements

- Basic HTML and CSS for static content.
- JavaScript can be used to enhance interactivity (e.g., form handling, filters, and navigation).

### Usage

- **User Screens**: Users can search, filter, book, and view their bookings.
- **Admin Screens**: Administrators can manage flight destinations and flights.
